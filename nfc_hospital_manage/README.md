    Introduction
“Near-field communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols for communication between two electronic devices over a distance of 4 cm (11⁄2 in) or less.” 
Due to the nature of the NFC protocol a wide variety of use-cases exist such as for payment, secured access, locating devices, sharing small amounts of data etc. However, greater functionality can be achieved when used in conjunction with other technologies.  
We intended to see how the power of NFC can be amplified by using it with Cloud services, Machine Learning, IoT and Mobile Technologies. We believe that technology could serve for the greater good of society. Hence, we tried to solve one to the issues in the health service sector by using all the technologies mentioned previously. 
We noticed that in our local hospital the only way for a patient admitted can call for assistance is by vocally calling for help. This seems to be simple and efficient enough for most of the time. But often we find that such a mechanism fails when the patient is in critical conditions. For example, when a patient is unconscious or paralyzed, it would be very difficult for such patients to call for help using their vocals.
Our proposed system provides an efficient mechanism to automate the process of attending the admitted patient’s needs and provides a way to collect and log all the events.
